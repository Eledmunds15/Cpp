# Cpp
Learning how to program in Cpp using NESO Academy's course on Youtube @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0g4ty29Xgg&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRh6isJ01MBnbNpV3ZsktSyS&ab_channel=NesoAcademy

## 1. Introduction to C++
- A general purpose programming language (Can be used in multiple applications)
- Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs
- Runs on variety of platforms including Windows and MacOS

Cpp is mainly an extension of C#:
- Supports Object Oriented Programming
- Supports data abstraction
- Supports generic programming

Variable: Something that can hold a value

## 2. Writing a Simple C++ Program
Function: Every C++ program must contain functions, one of which must be called 'main'. A function is a block of code that executes a series of commands. The OS runs a C++ program by running the 'main' function.

### Elements of a function decleration
4 main elements:
- Return type
- Name of function
- Parameter (input) list
- Function body

### Types
A fundamental concept in Computer Science that defines the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on those data.

Example variable decleration: int my_variable = 2;

## 3. Compiling and Executing C++ Programs
Compiling
- Having writen a program, you need to compile it in order to run it.
- Compiling is the transformation from source code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable).

## 4. Input and Output in C++
C++ does not define any statements that all you to input or output (IO). Instead, C++ includes an extensive standard library that provides IO and a lot of other facilities.

The iostream library allows a C++ programing to take inputs and give output to and from console. 'istream' is for inputs and 'ostream' is for output.

The iostream library defines 4 main statements:
- 'cin' standard input (istream)
- 'cout' standard output (ostream)
- 'cerr' standard error (ostream)
- 'clog' general information (ostream)
